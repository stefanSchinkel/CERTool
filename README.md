##CERTool

This tool provides the basic functionality for reading and processing [CERT data](http://mplab.ucsd.edu/~marni/Projects/CERT.htm) data in order to construct **FA**cial e**x**pr**e**ssion **N**etworks (FAXEN)

The intention here was to construct networks based on the joint activation of facial action units (AU) and correlate them with basic emotions. The idea  was never pursued any further (due to lack of funding).

I found it while cleaning and somebody might use it.
